<h4>Important: Windows Users</h4><p>In the next few lectures, lecture, I&nbsp;run multiple Go files at the same time on a Macintosh like this:</p><p>go run *.go</p><p>On Windows, though, this will not work unless you have customized your IDE or terminal. Instead, use this command:</p><p>go run .</p><p>(note the dot at the end of this command)</p><p>Thanks to Craig for pointing this out.</p>
